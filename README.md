# cards

A *card* is a small note or some kind of rich text, like a list or a piece of code.

The user does some typing and it's saved every few seconds. Then the user leaves the card as-is or it can be converted to another type.

Card Types:
- note
- doc
- list
- sheet
- code

Questions:
- are cards nested? Is the app just a single card, which is a list of cards, etc.
